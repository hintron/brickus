# Brickus

 Brickus is a 4-player turn-based board game. Each player starts with a piece touching a corner of the board and places one brick per turn. The game ends when no player can play anymore bricks, and the player who has the greatest score wins!

Note: Brickus is a completely original and novel game. This game contains no blocks whatsoever - just bricks.

## Future Improvements
* Explain how to build the game (Set up php with required modules, MySQL, import db schema, etc.)
* Undo last turn command (not necessarily the same as undo last piece command!)
* Improve color schemes via Adobe color picker (https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
* Multiple ongoing games, and allow user to select which game to play
* Create a win notification
* Use media queries to make sure the game renders on sundry devices
* Fit the game into the viewport better (don't show the other player's remaining pieces?)
* Incorporate touch events, so the game will work on touchscreens.
* Enforce correct piece placement
* Implement a turn timer
* Simple chat
* Add in more server-side checks to make sure people aren't cheating - keep track of piece values, player scores, and ids server side
* Only end the game if everyone agrees to
* Create an AI
* Create a next-best-move suggestion
