# Brickus

 Brickus is a 4-player turn-based board game. Each player starts with a piece touching a corner of the board and places one brick per turn. The game ends when no player can play anymore bricks, and the player who has the greatest score wins!

Note: Brickus is a completely original and novel game. This game contains no blocks whatsoever - just bricks.

## Future Improvements
* Multiple ongoing games, and allow user to select which game to play
* Enforce correct piece placement
* Simple chat
* Implement a turn timer
* Create a win notification
